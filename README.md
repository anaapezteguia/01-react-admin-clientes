# Pet appointment's manager

This project is a small appointment manager for veterinary patients made with React.

Through a form we insert appointments in an app that we can see on the same screen and save and/or delete them from Local Storage.

**What I've learned:** Props destructuring and using useEffect to control Local Storage.

This project is part of the Udemy [React - La Guía Completa: Hooks Context Redux MERN +15 Apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-de-principiante-a-experto-creando-mas-de-10-aplicaciones/) course.
